# Hamoye Tag-Along code
This repository showcases the development  of solutions to Machine Learning Quizzes during my participation in the Hamoye Data Science Internship. The work done is explained in stages.

## Stage A 
In stage A of my internship at Hamoye, I worked on basic data manipulation. The dataset was provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, I made use of functions like group by, corr for correlation, sum for summation, mean, max, and std for standard deviation. I also used basic statistical tools to extract information from the dataset.

## Stage B
In this stage, I focus on gaining Machine Learning Regression skills by Predicting the Energy Efficiency of Buildings. The dataset for this stage, which is the Appliances Energy Prediction data, is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators that are used by the machine learning community for the empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms. The data set is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. I work on Linear regression analyzing only one independent variable impacting the slope of the relationship with a dependent variable. I also worked on Multiple Linear regression where I predicted the output of a dependent variable based on inputs from multiple dependent variables.
