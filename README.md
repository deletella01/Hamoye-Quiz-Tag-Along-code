This repository showcases the development  of solutions to Machine Learning Quizzes during my participation in the Hamoye Data Science Internship. The work done is explained in stages.

## Stage A 
In stage A of my internship at Hamoye, I worked on basic data manipulation. The dataset was provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, I made use of functions like group by, corr for correlation, sum for summation, mean, max, and std for standard deviation. I also used basic statistical tools to extract information from the dataset.
